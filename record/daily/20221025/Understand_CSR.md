Understand CSR
====================

Control and Status Register ([CSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control/Status_Register)) is a resigter in many centrl processing units that are used as storage devices for information about instructions received from machines.

The device is generally placed in the register address 0 and 1 in CPUs and works on the concept of using a comparison of flags (carry, overflow and zero, usually) to decide on various if-then instructions related to electronic decision flows.

CSR单元主要负责特权级指令的执行以及例外/中断的处理。
