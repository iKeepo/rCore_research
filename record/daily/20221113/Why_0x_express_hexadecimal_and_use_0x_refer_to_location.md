Why use 0x express hexadecimal and 0x express address in Computer
====================

### Why are hexadecimal numbers prefixed with 0x?

`0x` is a prefix to indicate the number is in hexadecimal rather than in some other base.

The programming language uses it to tell compiler.

The `0` tells the parser it's dealing with a constant (not an identifier/reserved word).

It is unambiguous since it still starts with a number character so can;t be a valid identifier.

The `x` is an arbitrary choice.

The preceding 0 is used to indicate a number in base 2,8,16,`0x` was chosen to indicate hex because `x` sounds like hex.

### Why using Hexadecimal values for computer addressing?

Binary is most direct one to use, but to huge.

So people grouped them up to have four of them together then found 16 symbols to indicate them 0,1,2...,E,F and put them on after the other.

It is small easy to convert to original binary and as straight forward as it could be.
